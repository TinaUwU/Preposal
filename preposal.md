# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

We are planning to make a visual novel with (hopefully) our own music, art, sfx, then we will be splitting the work of doing all the code. I believe that we will be doing it via ren'py. We will give it atleast 2 endings (1 bad, 1 good) within the time we were given and implement a mechanic where the player will organize pieces of information into a file. Raphael probably has a more indepth description on his preposal.



## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

THE GOAT **Raphael Kua** who is talented in the arts of everything to be honest, tup73785@temple.edu, TA: Tomoya Kanno



## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not in particular right now.
